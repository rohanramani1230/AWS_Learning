- A content delivery network is a system of distributed servers that deliver webpages and other 
  web contents to a user based on the geographic locationns of the user, the origin of the 
  webpage, and a content delivery server. 

- Edge locations are locations where content will be cached. This is separate to an AWS Region/AZ

- Origin - This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. This can be an S3 
  Bucket, an EC2 instance, an elastic load balancer, or Route53. 

- Distribution - This is the name given the CDN which consists of a collection of edge locations.

- Amazon cloudfront can be used to deliver your entire website, including dynanmic, static
  and interactive content using a global network of edge locations. Requests for your contetn are 
  automatically routed to the nearest edge location so content is delivered with the best possible  performance.

- Two types of distribution
	- Web Distribution
	- RTMP Distribution - Streaming. 

- Edge locations are not just READ only -- you can write to them too.
- Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (Time to Live)
- You can clear cached objects but you will be charged.
