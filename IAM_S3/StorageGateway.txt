- AWS Storage gateway is a service that connects an on-premises software applicance with 
  cloudbased storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an organization's on
  premises IT environment and AWS storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely
  store data to the AWS cloud for scalable and cost effective storage. 

- AWS Storage gateway software appliance is available for download as a virtual machine that you
  install on a host in your datacenter. Stotrage gateway supports either VMware ESXI or 
  Microsoft Hyper-V. Once you've installed your gateway and associated it with your AWS account
  through the activation process, you can use the AWS Management console to create the storage
  gateway option that is right for you. 

- Three different types of Storage
	- File Gateway
		- Storing files
	- Volume Gateway
		- Storing hardisks
		- Stored Volumes
		- Cached Volumes
	- Tape Gateway


	- Files are stored as objects in S3 buckets, accessed through a Network File System 
mount point. Ownership, permissions and timestamps are durably stored in S3 in the user-metadata
of the object associated with the file. Once objects are transferred to S3, they can be managed as native S3 objects and bucket policices such as versioning, lifecycle management, and cross
region replication apply directly to objects stored in your bucket. 

- The Volume interface presents your applications with disk volumes using the iSCSCI block
  protocol. 

- Data written to these volumes can be ascynchronously backed up as point in time snapshots and
  stored in the cloud as Amazon EBS snapshots

- Snapshots are incremental backups that capture only changed blocks. All snapshot storage is al
  so compressed to minimize your storage charges. 

- Stored volumes let you store your primary data locally while asynchronously backing up that
  data to AWS. Stored volumes provide your on-premises applications with low-latency access to
  their entire datasets, while providing durable off-site backups. You can create storage 
  volumes and mount them an iSCSCI devices from your on-premises application servers. Data
  written to your stored volumes is stored on your on premises storage hardware. This data is
  asynchronously backed up to Amazon S3 in the form of Amazon Elastic Block store snapshots. 

- Cached volumes let you use S3 as your primary data storage while retaining frequently accessed
  data locally in your storage gateway. Cached volumes minimize the need to scale your on 
  premises storage infrastructure, while still providing your applications with low-latency 
  access to their frequently accessed data. You can create storage volumes up to 32 TiB in size
  and attach to them as iSCSI devices from your on premises application servers. Your gateway
  stores data that you write to these volumes in S3 and retains recently read data in your on
  premises storage gateway's cache and upload buffer storage. 1GB - 32 TB in size for Cached 
  Volumes. 

- Cached volumes does most actively used data while stored volumes does all. 

- Tape Gateway offers a durable, cost-effective solution to archive your data in the AWS cloud. 
  The VTL interface it provides lets you leverage your existing tape-based backup application 
  infrastructure to store data on virtual tape cartridges that you create on your tape gateway. 
  Each tape gateway is preconfigured with a media changer and tape drives, which are available 
  to your existing client backup applications as iSCSCI devices. You add tape cartridges as you
  need to archive your data. Supported by NetBackup, Backup Exec, Veeam etc.
