- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the
  cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes,
  allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

- On Demand: Hourly
- Reserved: Contract with more up front becoming cheaper
- Spot: Moves Around like stock
- Dedicated Hosts: Get dedicated machine to you.

- If the spot instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of
  usage. However if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which
  the instance ran.
